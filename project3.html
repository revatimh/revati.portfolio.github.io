  <!-- Executive Summary -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project focuses on the challenges startups and community labs face while engaging with the EnvisAGE program at UHN. It examines the lack of clarity around program roles, scattered access to information, and late funding rules that discourage participants from continuing beyond the initial stage. <br><br>
      
      By mapping expectations against the actual program journey, the study highlights where participants encounter barriers that impact trust, visibility, and long-term involvement. The insights aim to improve communication, establish transparency around responsibilities, and strengthen outreach. Additionally, it proposes design directions to create a clearer, more accessible, and supportive experience for all EnvisAGE stakeholders.</p>

  <!-- Problem Statement -->
  <section class="section highlight">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p><strong>What problems do CLs and SMEs encounter when navigating the EnvisAGE application, particularly around understanding roles, accessing clear information, and managing funding requirements across different application stages?</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- Focus -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Main Focus</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Poor Visibility and Outreach: The program is mostly visible to insiders, with little public content or applicant guidance.</li>
      <li>Overwhelming Application Process: The application process is complex, jargon-heavy, and lacks clear onboarding or support tools.</li>
      <li>Unclear Role Definitions: There’s no shared understanding of what is the role of UHN as a Beachhead.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>


  <!-- Research Approach -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Research Approach</h2>
    <p>The project explored EnvisAGE’s process through impact gap mapping and stakeholder collaboration. Program touchpoints were examined to identify where participants lose clarity or momentum. Input from UHN stakeholders helped surface recurring gaps, such as uncertainty about funding distribution, the role of Beachheads, and how applicants discover program opportunities.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Findings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Findings and Key Insights</h2>

    <h3>1. Unclear Roles</h3>
    <p>The Beachhead’s role is vague, making labs unsure of what support they can rely on.</p>

    <h3>2. Fragmented Access to Information</h3>
    <p>Information and tools are fragmented, making it hard for applicants to find details, apply smoothly, and see the program’s value.</p>

    <h3>3. Inconsistent Funding Rules</h3>
    <p>Funding rules are inconsistent and unclear, leaving labs and SMEs uncertain about what to expect.</p>

    <h3>4. Lack of Awareness</h3>
    <p>Program awareness is low, with many hearing about Envisage only through conferences or word-of-mouth.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Design Direction -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Design Directions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity in program roles:</strong> Define Beachhead responsibilities in clear, accessible terms to help labs understand expectations.</li>
      <li><strong>Centralized information access:</strong>Create a single, well-structured source of truth for program requirements, processes, and updates.</li>
      <li><strong>Outreach strategy:</strong> Expand communication channels beyond conferences to reach more startups and labs.</li>
      <li><strong>Share success stories:</strong> Share success stories and case examples to build credibility and motivate new participants. </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
