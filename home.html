        <h1>Creative designer crafting digital experiences</h1>
        <h2>Hi, my name is Revati.</h2>
        
        <p>I am a UX researcher and a human-centred designer. I love creating digital experiences that are thoughtful, accessible, and actually helpful to the people using them. I care deeply about good design, not just in how it looks, but in how it works for everyone.
        <br>
        I’ve taken part in a few design hackathons and really enjoy problem-solving through creativity and critical thinking. Outside of design, you’ll usually find me reading, cooking something new, organizing (yes, I genuinely like cleaning!), or just spending quiet time with my close-knit circle of people.</p>
