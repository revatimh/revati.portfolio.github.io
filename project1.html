      <h1>Connecting Flights</h1>
      <h2> Understanding Passenger Rights and Flight Disruption Experiences</h2>
      <p class="subtitle">A UX research project uncovering the communication gap between airlines and passengers during
        flight disruptions.</p>
    </div>
  </header>

  <!-- Executive Summary -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This research focuses on the communication gap between airlines and passengers, especially during flight disruptions. It examines the reasons behind the unawareness of passengers about their rights and compensation knowledge, which often leads to frustration and dissatisfaction. <br> <br>
      
      By analyzing their expectations and experiences, the study aims to improve airline communication, reduce confusion, and enhance overall customer trust. Additionally, it proposes solutions to minimize issues, ensuring a smoother and more informed travel experience.</p>

  <!-- Problem Statement -->
  <section class="section highlight">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p><strong>What are the factors contributing to the communication gap between passengers’ experiences and their
        expectations during a flight disruption?</strong></p>
  </section>

  <!-- Objectives -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify information barriers for passengers and explore ways to establish clarity.</li>
      <li>Analyze how past experiences shape passenger expectations.</li>

  </section>

  <!-- Existing Solutions -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Existing Solutions and Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Compensation System:</strong> Monetary compensation exists, but many passengers are unaware of it.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Quality of Service:</strong> Airline staff receive training but communication inconsistencies remain.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Awareness:</strong> Passengers often only discover their rights during disruptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Communication:</strong> Airlines disclose limited or unclear details.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Demographics -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Demographic Details</h2>
    <p>The study focused on passengers who:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Were between <strong>18–30 years old</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Flew internationally</strong> in the last two years</li>
      <li><strong>Traveled in economy class</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Booked tickets</strong> in one package</li>
      <li>Had at least <strong>one connecting flight</strong></li>
      <li>Often <strong>traveled alone</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Methodology -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
    <p>The project used a <strong>mixed-methods approach</strong> combining qualitative and quantitative research:</p>

    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Findings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Findings and Key Insights</h2>

    <h3>1. Communication Gaps</h3>
    <p>Passengers lose trust due to insufficient information during disruptions.</p>
    <blockquote>“Knowing nothing is more concerning than knowing the truth.”</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Rebuild trust through transparent communication.</p>

    <h3>2. Lack of Awareness of Rights</h3>
    <p>Many passengers were unaware of APPR (Air Passenger Protection Rights).</p>
    <blockquote>“I would have expected compensation but I assume this was not contemplated in the law.”</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Create awareness about passenger rights.</p>

    <h3>3. Complex and Lengthy Documentation</h3>
    <p>Only 21.9% of respondents read the APPR; most found it difficult.</p>
    <blockquote>“It’s like reading a textbook. It would be better if important points were highlighted.”</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Simplify the APPR and highlight key points.</p>

    <h3>4. Confusion Over Eligibility</h3>
    <p>56.1% of passengers were entitled to compensation, but only 29.2% pursued it.</p>
    <blockquote>“So it’s like what needs to happen for me to have the right to get compensation?”</blockquote>
    <p><strong>Opportunity:</strong> Develop tools to clarify eligibility and processes.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The research highlighted that the real barrier in disrupted air travel is not compensation itself but the
      <strong>lack of awareness and clarity</strong>. By improving communication, simplifying documents, and making
      rights accessible, passengers can feel empowered and informed even in stressful travel situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Project Inform-Me-Right</strong> demonstrates how user-centered research and design can close the gap
      between passenger expectations and airline communication, ultimately creating a more transparent and trustworthy
      travel experience.</p>
