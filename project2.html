  <!-- Executive Summary -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This project aims to design a more user-friendly online healthcare appointment scheduling system that meets patient needs while improving administrative efficiency. Older adults show strong interest in health technologies, yet they face barriers such as small device screens, high costs, and frequent reliance on family for technical help. Many prefer step-by-step instructions and simple troubleshooting, highlighting the importance of intuitive design and clear guidance.
<br><br>
Research shows a decline in access to primary care in Canada, with millions lacking regular providers and same-day appointments remaining far below peer countries. Although many clinics offer online booking, adoption is still limited, with only a small portion of patients using these services. At the same time, feedback on virtual care is highly positive, especially among patients with chronic conditions.
<br><br>
Despite the availability of some digital tools like email communication and medical record access, many older adults and less tech-savvy users remain dependent on outdated phone systems. Existing platforms such as Porton Health, TELUS Health, and Scarborough Health Network demonstrate progress but also reveal fragmented systems and accessibility gaps. This project therefore responds to the growing demand for a unified, accessible, and widely adopted digital healthcare scheduling solution.</p>

     <li>Literature review</li>
     <li>Competitive analysis</li>
     <li>Heuristic evaluation</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Findings -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>Key Learnings</h2>

    <h3>Usability Issues</h3>
    <p>Many platforms lack real-time updates, clear feedback, and intuitive navigation, leading to confusion during the booking process.</p>

    <h3>User Control & Freedom</h3>
    <p>Users struggle with modifying, canceling, or rescheduling appointments due to limited control over their actions.</p>

    <h3>Accessibility Gaps</h3>
    <p>Missing features like screen reader compatibility, language support, and voice commands reduce inclusivity.</p>

    <h3>Design Consistency</h3>
    <p>Inconsistent UI elements, overwhelming layouts, and cluttered screens impact user experience and decision-making.</p>

  <!-- Conclusion -->
  <section class="section bg-alt">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The research highlighted that the real barrier in disrupted air travel is not compensation itself but the
      <strong>lack of awareness and clarity</strong>. By improving communication, simplifying documents, and making
      rights accessible, passengers can feel empowered and informed even in stressful travel situations.</p>
    <p><strong>Project Inform-Me-Right</strong> demonstrates how user-centered research and design can close the gap
      between passenger expectations and airline communication, ultimately creating a more transparent and trustworthy
      travel experience.</p>
